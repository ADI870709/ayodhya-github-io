    <p>Ayodhya, also known as Saket, is an ancient city of India, is the birthplace of Bhagwan Shri Ram and setting of the great epic Ramayana. Ayodhya used to be the capital of the ancient Kosala Kingdom. It has an average elevation of 93 meters (305 feet). Owing to the belief as the birthplace of Bhagwan Shri Ram, Ayodhya (Awadhpuri) has been regarded as first one of the seven most important pilgrimage sites (Mokshdayini Sapt Puris) for Hindus.[6]

        The early Buddhist and Jain canonical texts mention that the religious leaders Gautama Buddha and Mahavira visited and lived in the city. The Jain texts also describe it as the birthplace of five tirthankaras namely, Rishabhanatha, Ajitanatha, Abhinandananatha, Sumatinath and Anantnath, and associate it with the legendary Bharata Chakravarti. From the Gupta period onwards, several sources mention Ayodhya and Saketa as the name of the same city.</p>

            <li><b>GUPTAR GHAT</b></li>
            <hr>
            <p>Situated on the banks of River Saryu, Guptar Ghat holds immense religious significance. According to legend, this was the place where Lord Rama had taken his last dip (jal samadhi) to leave the earth and go back to his original abode 'Vaikunta'. It is a popular belief among devotees that taking a dip in the Saryu river on this ghat will wash away their sins and relieve them from worldly worries. The ghat resounds with the chants of Lord Rama's name as devotees and priests sing hymns in his praises. Tourists can also visit Raja Mandir and Chakra Harji Vishnu Temple located near Guptar Ghat, which is lined with temples of Ram Janki, Charan Paduka, Narasingh and Lord Hanuman. The well-maintained ghats were built by Raja Darshan Singh during the first half of the 19th century.</p>
